## 👾 Overview

RemNote Gamepad Controller (RGC) is a RemNote Plugin that allows you to connect your favorite game controller to RemNote and use it to navigate your flashcard queue. RGC is designed to be simple and easy to use, so you can spend less time configuring and more time studying. (Works out of the box with most controllers!)

## 📅 Planned Features

- [ ] Controller Profiles for different controllers (e.g. You can have a profile for your Joycon (R) and another for your 8BitDo SN30 Pro)
  - [ ] Support for Nintendo Switch Joycons (L/R, as pair or individually)
  - [ ] Button Binding UI
- [ ] Indicator for when controller is connected

Have an idea for a new feature? [Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) to RGC development!
